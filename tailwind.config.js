```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
    "./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

With this boilerplate, the developer has a well-structured application that they can use to pull the source code, run the development server, and identify/build fix errors effectively. The integration of Express.js will allow for easy debugging of API routes while maintaining a modern frontend with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.
