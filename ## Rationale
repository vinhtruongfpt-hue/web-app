Based on the product requirement of debugging and fixing build errors in a web application, I recommend using **Next.js** paired with **Tailwind CSS** for the frontend. Next.js provides an excellent structure for building React applications and includes built-in support for both server-side rendering and static site generation, making it suitable for efficient development and easier debugging. Tailwind CSS will help in rapidly styling the application without the hassle of writing extensive custom CSS.

For the backend, we'll use **Express.js** due to its simplicity and flexibility, making it a good choice for handling API requests, especially during debugging and fixing build errors.
