For the given product requirement, it seems like you need a simple web application that allows users to upload their source code for checking and fixing build errors. The ideal stack for this requirement would be **Next.js with FastAPI**. 

- **Next.js** is a React-based framework that provides server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes out-of-the-box, making it great for a full-stack application.
- **FastAPI** is a modern web framework for building APIs in Python based on standard Python type hints, which will allow for quick error checking and reporting.

This stack is chosen for its robustness, ease of development, and the ability to handle both the frontend user interface and backend API seamlessly.
